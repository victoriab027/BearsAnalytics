### Data Set and Important Files  
The data set is a sample of 200,000 customers who have purchased a car from CarMax and their accompanying appraisal details. An appraisal is an offer amount from CarMax to buy a customer's vehicle. Often, CarMax customers use the appraisal offer to purchase another vehicle through a trade-in.  
  
Each row contains data on a customer's appraised vehicle and the vehicle they purchased from CarMax.   
Appraised vehicle data can be identified by the suffix *'_appraisal'* (for example, *'make_appraisal'* identifies the make of the vehicle customers sold to CarMax).

Disclaimer: This is real CarMax data, however, this data is not representative of all current CarMax inventory and business.

### Challenge  
**Many customers decide to trade-in their current vehicle when purchasing a vehicle at CarMax.  
  What does a customer's appraised vehicle tell us about the vehicle they will end up purchasing?    
  How can CarMax use this information to improve business operations and provide customers a personalized shopping experience?**
